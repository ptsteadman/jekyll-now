title: How To Impress Employers at Infosessions 
---
Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack of
pre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, in order to snag the programmers
and UX designers who really stand out.  Instead of spending valuable time 
validating a particularly promising candidate's skillset through a protracted
series of interviews, it's often more efficient to give the individual an
offer right at the information session.  Internal studies at Google have shown
that experienced recruiters can often tell if a programmer has 'what it takes'
just from how they act an infosession: the insightful questions they ask, the
stickers on their laptop, and how they comport themselves in general.

Here are some of tips for optimizing your infosession performance:

- Ask questions to get a feel for the company's culture.  For example, I always
  start off by asking "do you have a mandatory drug test?".

- Don't be that awkward guy who goes up for more pizza while the presenter is
  providing valuable information about the company's agile development
cycle. Instead, demonstrate your ability to amortize I/O costs via bulk loading:
bring a whole box of pizza back to your seat.  Protip: "free swag" t-shirts make
great face rags, so grab a handful.

- Stay focused by minimizing distractions.  I typically wear my Bose
  QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones during the presentation.  This way I
retain more information from the PowerPoint, which really impresses the
recruiters during the post-presentation networking session.  Follow me on Spotify to
follow my special "Let's Do This Infosession" playlist.

- Getting invited to the 'after-infosession' is critical.  During the networking
  session, ask the recruiters what hotel they're staying at, and demonstrate how
networked you are by making sure that they know that you 'know a guy'.  Without
fail, someone will slip a wax-sealed envelope under your door at midnight,
an invitation to an another, more exclusive networking event.  

If you follow these simple tips and brush up on your data structures, you'll
soon be literally *drowning* in offers, like everyone else.  If these tips don't work
for you, you probably need to get your MEng.
